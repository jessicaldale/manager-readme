Our client approached us with the task of prototyping a 'disruptive' streaming media concept. Being late to market was a huge challenge, so their objectives focused on differentiating their product by targeting cord-cutting millennials as the primary persona, paying special attention to their digital behaviors/expectations.

Goal: Design a concept model that could be tested with users to gauge interest and presented to stakeholders to gain internal buy-in.

Role: My role was to lead UX, which included creating and prioritizing user stories and features, identifying key user flows for testing, wireframing content priority templates and sketching through UI ideas with the team. At the close of each 4-week sprint, I presented our design thinking to the stakeholders in an open feedback session.

Process: I began this project with asking some questions in order to define the problem and understand what the design should solve for.

How do we get our users to the content they want faster and with less friction?
How might the medium and context change the experience?
How can we make this experience adaptive?
What questions do we need to answer through prototyping?

How
My first step was brainstorming a feature grid based on the provided business requirements and user needs, with additional landscape research helping identify where boundaries could be pushed. I then collaborated with the product manager to create a comprehensive list of user stories. I sketched through several iterations of the flow diagrams as we received client feedback with new information on content availability. I documented the final flows in Omnigraffle and created a presentation to review information architecture with stakeholders. We then created scripts and a prototype with hi-fidelity comps for user testing.

Why
The prototype represents the primary user flow based on the user stories we had written and the prioritization of features we defined. A diagram was created to outline a path through some of the key functionality of the product in order to surface opportunities to explore and test ideas. It also highlighted some of the complexities around where and when content was surfaced, which helped to steer conversations with stakeholders.

Solution: After several iterations, we outlined user flows that covered key interactions (browse/watch) and turned them into an Invision prototype.

Results: Since the number one goal was entering the market with a strong product to compete, we knew that user adoption would be a priority. We began conducting usability tests early on and saw positive responses to the prototype which helped validate product direction. We also developed a presentation framework to walk through the design process and familiarize our client stakeholders with some of the problems we were trying to solve for, the proposed solutions,  the pros/cons behind each option, and explanation of decisions made.
